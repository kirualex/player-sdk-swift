# 2021-05-10 : IMPORTANT NOTE 
# When YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework.zip is built with xcodebuild version 12.5, 
# playing opus streams on real iOS devices crashes.
#
# Until the bug is fixed this test uses installed version 12.4 of xcodebuild.

# Comment the following line to use the default installation on the system.
