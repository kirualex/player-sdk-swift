# Generates the YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework from player-sdk-swift.xcodeworkspace.
# Usage: no parameters, settings mostly defined in xcode xcodeworkspace
# 

# 2021-05-10 : IMPORTANT NOTE FOR BUILDING
# When YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework.zip is built with xcodebuild version 12.5, 
# playing opus streams on real iOS devices crashes.
#
# Until the bug is fixed this build uses installed version 12.4 of xcodebuild.
#
# Comment the following line to use the default installation on the system.
