# How to contribute?

First of all. Thank you for considering to contribute to this project.

## Issues

You are welcome to state your wishes in terms of [issues](https://github.com/ybrid/player-sdk-swift/issues) in this project. Of course reporting of bugs is favored in this transparent way, too. Please consider using a matching [label](https://github.com/ybrid/player-sdk-swift/labels) if possible.

## Tests

We do not own all exisiting iOS device types of the past and the future. So running the [example app](https://github.com/ybrid/app-example-ios) on your device and telling us about success and failures will help us improve the power of this software.

## Tell us your needs

### package management

Currently we support integration with CocoaPods. You may tell us which type of package management you need.

### features

We are in the middle of implementing more functionality. What do you want to be implemented next?
